### Documentation

This is a single page website formatted as a business card. I was attempting to communicate who I was as a person, my interests, while still communicating what I specialized in. I've never done personal branding before but I wanted to make it something I would enjoy looking at, so I chose to implement some aspects of graphic design that I enjoy, like a blackletter font, moths, and screenwriting. 

I learned the basics of making a website and coding in html and css. I learned how to create links and svgs, and how to format headings.
I'm most proud of making the multiply effects overlap, since thats a very important aspect of screen printing. I didn't have many pictures, and the ones I did were very simple to describe. Using adobe color pallets, I made sure to pick accessible colors.
