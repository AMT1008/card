## Documentation

This is a single page website formatted as a buisness card. I learned the basics of making a website and coding in html and css. I learned how to createimplement links and svgs, how to format headings.  I've never done personal branding before but I wanted to make it something i would enjoy looking at, so I chose to impliment some aspects of graphic design that I enjoy, like a blackletter font, moths, and screenprinting.
